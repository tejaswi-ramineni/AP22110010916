The question is to develop AVERAGE CALCULATOR HTTP MICROSERVICE

First, I registered using the register API and got the client ID and client Secret through which I was able to generate the token.

Here are the screenshots I took

As the token expired after few minutes, I was unable to test the API's properly.
